This is a Java based interpreter of my tiny custom language PumpkinPie.

Right now it is completely based off of the book [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom][]

[Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom]: https://dart.dev/

If you, by any chance, stumbled upon this repo and have a few minutes to spare -- feel free to tinker with it.

Current Goals:
1. Finish the base interpreter____________________________________________Done
2. Rewrite parts of the code to Scala_____________________________________PLANNED
3. Add functions and flesh out the language_______________________________PLANNED
4. Flesh out this README with installation and deployment guides____________PLANNED

Will I ever finish these goals? Who knows, who knows...
